            <p>
            I am Mohammad Sohan from Bangladesh. Highly passionate to work as a MERN Stack Web Developer for a software firm where I can leverage my talents in Web Development.

I like to do web coding, fixing problem, and designing websites. I always learn new things about Web Dev regularly as trends go on. My heavy skills are HTML 5, CSS 3, Bootstrap 5, JavaScript, ReactJS & GitHub. My coding is pixel perfect and also responsive, full, and fresh hand code. I focus on 3 things on every project: Communication, Quality, and Support.
